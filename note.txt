Modern cpp
    -All versions of c++ since c++11

cpp is revised/updated every 3 years
so verisons of c++ are: c++11, c++id, c++17


5 Weeks


     A->Essentials of modern cpp (fundamentals)
     B->Functional programming in Modern cpp
     C->Concurrency & c++ 17
     D->STL DS & Algorithm

     Feature 1: In class initialization
     Fearure 2 : enum class

     Fetaure 3: Enable/disable special member functions aka default/deleted membar function
                 

                you can choose whether to enable or disable & special member functions for a class you are creating

                a) Default constructor
                b)destructor
                c)copy constructor
                d)copy assignment operator = (overload = operator)
                e)move constructor (new feature in c++ 11)
                f)move assignment operator = (overload = operator for move)

     Feature 4: NULL is replaced with nullptr
      Feature 4: uniform initialization
          We can initialize variables in a function using {}

           NULL alter name for 0

           employee* ptr =10;

     Feature 5: uniform initialization
         we can initialize variables in a function using ()


          NULL alter name for 0

          employee** ptr =0; //valid code

          //do actions only on pointer type "null"?

     Feature 6: member list initialization

     Feature 7: auto ketword
                detect and infer thentype of variables
                BASED ON INTIAL VALUE

     Feature 8: constructor delegation          
     you can transfer/shift control of the program from one constructor to another in 
     the same class



     Arrangement or structuring the data

     A) consecutively. one after the another in the memory
         a) No option for adding no data will be provided

            28          35        29
           0x100H    0x104H     0x108H

           Employee 4 : 36

         b) We can add more data values if required, in future

             [ ///////////////////////]

                    TRANSFER DATA TO A NEW REGION IN MEMORY
  

              28       35         29       36
             0x200H   0x204H    0x208H    0X212H

     EVERYTHING IS AN ILLUSION

     THERE IS NO ARRAY THERE IS NO STACK, THERE IS NO LIST




DATA STRUCTURE

       a)Data structure is arrangament of data, different ways of retrieving or accessing data

       b)Data structure are theoretical and philosophical. they have to implement in the code

       c)Implementation of data structures an different platform or in different libraries may
         different to behaviour

       d)There are "infinite" data structures in the world

       e) Data structure Implementations have to follow rule or syntax of the language
