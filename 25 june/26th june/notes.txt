     In aggregation demo code,



          -replace c style arrays with vectors
          -Add a feature to filter employees based on filter predicates
               (functional style) [Filter LAMBDA]
          -Add a feature to calculate bonus for each employee using a formula
               given by the user (functional style)  [MAPPING LAMBDA]
               example: each emploee gets 2000 rs bonus
               example:
